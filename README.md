# HookBreaker V1.0.0

- First ever Runtime HookDetector ! (Made by oracledsc, thanks Shaun for the idea !)

# How to use ? 

- Make sure the guy is installing it through my github and has no tampermonkey installed on his browser (IMPORTANT)
- Make him run it while he test, this will completly break his hook and make it completly useless/not working or even break his Discord in some case
- NOTE: This should be used for HOF and Higher tests, for Tiers its completly overkill just use UnNatty-Detector and if it's blatant send a rec to list owners.

# Why is it not Open-Source ?

- Well my UnNattyDetector was open source, and this is how Ascend or other ChatGPT users bypassed it, so I decided to make this one Closed-Source
- This is verified and certified by Shaun, and completly safe, for any questions DM oracledsc
